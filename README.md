# Toledo Mobile Radio W8HHF Public PHP-based Facing Website
Notes

This repo contains the PHP version of the <a href="http://www.tmrahamradio.org">Toledo Mobile Radio Association's</a> website, created by <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/kj0eyt">KJ0EYT (Joe Thielen)</a> and modified by <a href="http://www.n8zak.com">N8ZAK</a> (Zachary Burns).  Changes were made and I needed a good spot to track changes and clean up some code for site re-design and migration.

Since some of this code contains directories, raw-data files, etc, etc, etc that I don't want to expose to the public, they have been marked with the words OBFUSCATED to throw the scent of the dogs off.  It's not that any of the code here is a security risk to the clubs members, etc, it's just not worthwhile to have out there.
